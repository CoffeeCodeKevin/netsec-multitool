## What is this?

This is a network security multi-tool I'm piecing together in Python. I will
probably be adding anything that I want to learn to code and interests me to it
(relating to network security, of course). Both the use and creation of this tool
are for learning purposes only.

The tool current supports the following functions:
  * Port scans - It can scan the ports of a given website or IP address with multithreading.
